## Installing The Foundry licence server

### Requirements

* A system running Docker 1.8 or above. (instruction are for Linux, but could be modified for Windows.)
* Ensure that ports 4101, 4012 and 5053 are open to the LAN on this system and not being used by another service.

### Gather System and Network Information

In Docker `mac address`, and `hostname` are easy to generate and setup. You need to use `--mac-address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx --hostname Hostname.you.want.to.use` when you run the container.

### Generate Licence File

1. Rename/Create the license file `foundry.lic`
 2. Save this file to your host in `/opt/foundry/foundry.lic`

### Create Docker Container and start service.

Type the following command.
```sh
docker build --no-cache -t Licence.Container.Name .
docker run --mac-address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx --hostname Hostname.you.want.to.use -v /opt/foundry:/opt/foundry -it Licence.Container.Name
```
This will now launch and install license on the licence server


### Logging

Docker's built-in logging functionality will collect the stdout/stderr generated by license server.

    docker logs [CONTAINER_ID]

Thus it's recommended you do NOT use the '-l' flag to log to a file, doing so will cause your Docker logs to be empty.  Additionally, avoid using the '-t' flag when using the 'run' command, enabling TTL support will cause extra line breaks in your Docker logs.

## Troubleshooting

If you are unsure if the server is running correctly, you can log into the container.

    docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash

Once in bash run:

    cd /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.3 && ./FoundryLicenseUtility -s status
